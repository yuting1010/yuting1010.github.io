    <p>I started taking training classes as a model from the fifth grade, walking behind the stage to the end of the runway. My dream is to be a person making impacts.</p>

    <p>Since middle school, I started doing competitive mathematics and running. This newfound love brought me to the University of Michigan, where I would dream bigger. I've been learning Web development since high school. UofM allows me to gain professional study in Computer Science. After taking Statistics courses, I sincerely enjoy how statistical views bring me a better understanding of the data and laws. So I decided to get a second major in Statistics.</p>

    <p>While absorbing new things, I begin teaching young students at Juni-learning how to code. I wanted to offer the same opportunities I had to inspire others. That inspiration was two-folded; from my kids, I learned patience, compassion, and kindness.</p>

    <p>I grew up in the City of Peony - Luoyang in China. My parents raised me with love and wisdom. Every summer in primary and middle schools, my mom took me to different places, from small towns in China, Singapore, Japan, Europe, etc. An open-minded me was gradually growing up. Now, I continue to learn and embrace different cultures by studying my third language - Japanese, and making friends worldwide.</p>

    <p>I am a brave explorer, wanting to try various broad things. I am a lifelong learner eager for discoveries and change. I hope to bring insight and reach new horizons following that curious and passionate young girl's dreams.</p>
